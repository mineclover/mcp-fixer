# Feature Specification: MCP Server Fixed Interface Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `002-claude-mcp-add`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp , claude mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp 는 테스트 케이스의 좋은 예시들임  https://docs.anthropic.com/ko/docs/claude-code/mcp 문서를 참고하면 좋음 notion mcp의 경우 최신 스펙의 oauth 로그인을 통해 권한은 설정하는 플로우를 테스트 할 수 있음
 이러한 mcp들의 정보를 기반으로 인터페이스를 특정 목적에 맞게 고정 하는게 과제임
 모든 mcp tools를 항상 조회하지 않고 고정된 이름과 인터페이스로 특정 기능만 빠르게 쓸 수 있는 mcp 서버
 추가 확장이 필요하면 그 때 mcp tool 리스트를 받고 인터페이스를 받고 실제로 요청을 보내보면서 성공적인 인터페이스를 연구하고 찾아낸 스펙을 등록 및 관리하는 게 중요한 목표 기존 @specs/001-mcp-tool-mcp/tasks.md 에서 이어진 작업으로  구체적인  기능들을 완성해나가는 것이 중요"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identified need for fixed MCP interface optimization with known examples (Context7, Notion)
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: developers using MCP tools
   → Actions: fixed interface registration, fast tool access, dynamic discovery when needed
   → Data: tool interfaces, registered specifications, OAuth flows
   → Constraints: performance optimization, avoiding repeated tool discovery
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Performance targets not specified]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Interface versioning strategy not defined]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary scenario: Register and use fixed interfaces for common MCP tools
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement focused on interface management and performance
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Fixed Interface, MCP Tool, Interface Specification, OAuth Configuration
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has performance uncertainties"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using MCP tools, I want to access commonly used MCP server functions through fixed, pre-defined interfaces so that I can avoid the overhead of dynamic tool discovery and achieve faster execution times for routine operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has Context7 and Notion MCP servers available, **When** they register fixed interfaces for common operations, **Then** they can access these functions using predefined commands without tool discovery overhead
2. **Given** fixed interfaces are registered for an MCP server, **When** the developer needs a new function not in the fixed set, **Then** the system dynamically discovers available tools, tests interfaces, and allows registration of successful specifications
3. **Given** Notion MCP server requires OAuth authentication, **When** the fixed interface is used, **Then** the authentication flow is handled seamlessly using stored credentials
4. **Given** multiple MCP servers with fixed interfaces, **When** accessing any registered function, **Then** response times are significantly faster than dynamic discovery

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a fixed interface specification becomes outdated due to server changes?
- How does the system handle OAuth token expiration during fixed interface usage?
- What occurs when an MCP server is unavailable but has registered fixed interfaces?
- How does the system manage interface conflicts between different MCP servers?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow registration of fixed interface specifications for MCP tools with predefined names and parameters
- **FR-002**: System MUST store and retrieve fixed interface specifications without requiring dynamic tool discovery for registered operations
- **FR-003**: System MUST support OAuth authentication flows for MCP servers that require it (like Notion)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide fast access to registered MCP tool functions through fixed interface names
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow dynamic discovery and testing of new MCP tool interfaces when expanding beyond fixed set
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate and test discovered interfaces before allowing registration as fixed specifications
- **FR-007**: System MUST manage authentication credentials securely for each registered MCP server
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain interface version compatibility and handle specification updates
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to register new fixed interfaces based on successful dynamic discovery sessions
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide performance metrics comparing fixed interface usage to dynamic discovery [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Performance targets not specified - what response time improvements are expected?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle MCP server availability issues gracefully for both fixed and dynamic interfaces
- **FR-012**: System MUST support interface specification backup and restoration [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Interface versioning strategy not defined - how are breaking changes handled?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Fixed Interface**: Represents a pre-defined, optimized interface specification for an MCP tool function with fixed naming and parameters
- **MCP Tool Registration**: Contains connection details, authentication requirements, and available interface specifications for an MCP server
- **Interface Specification**: Detailed definition of tool parameters, expected responses, and validation rules for a specific MCP function
- **OAuth Configuration**: Authentication setup and credential management for MCP servers requiring OAuth flows
- **Performance Metrics**: Records response times and success rates for fixed vs dynamic interface usage
