# Feature Specification: MCP Tool Management & Query System

**Feature Branch**: `001-mcp-tool-mcp`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "mcp tool을 사용하는 mcp인데 도구의 사용법을 이해한 후 해당 도구를 재사용하기 좋은 형태로 가공해서 쿼리의 형태로 저장, 같은 쿼리를 안정된 인터페이스로 cli를  통해 호출함으로써 사용, 커스텀 된 데이터 수집기를 등록할 수 있고 데이터 수집기의 결과를 쿼리에 전달하여 실행하는 방식으로 로직에대해  표준화  가능한 것이 핵심 , 기본적으로 mcp 스펙에서 지원하는 인증 방식을 대신 해주고 이 값들을 저장해서 차후 인증에 대한 로직이 생략되도록 편의성을 제공한다,"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Extract: MCP tool query standardization, CLI interface, data collectors, authentication management
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: tool discovery, query storage, standardized interface, data collection, authentication abstraction
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flow: tool discovery → query creation → reuse via CLI
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (queries, tools, collectors, credentials)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer working with MCP tools needs to repeatedly use complex tool operations. Instead of manually configuring authentication and parameters each time, they want to:
1. Discover available MCP tools and understand their capabilities
2. Create reusable queries that capture tool usage patterns
3. Execute these queries through a simple CLI interface
4. Register custom data collectors that feed into queries
5. Avoid authentication setup on subsequent uses

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new MCP tool is available, **When** the user explores it, **Then** the system learns its usage patterns and suggests queryable operations
2. **Given** a complex tool operation has been performed once, **When** the user wants to repeat it, **Then** they can save it as a reusable query with custom parameters
3. **Given** saved queries exist, **When** the user runs them via CLI, **Then** authentication and configuration are automatically handled
4. **Given** custom data collectors are needed, **When** the user registers them, **Then** their output can be used as input to any compatible query
5. **Given** authentication was configured once, **When** subsequent operations need the same credentials, **Then** no re-authentication is required

### Edge Cases
- What happens when MCP tool APIs change and break existing queries?
- How does the system handle authentication token expiration?
- What occurs when custom data collectors fail or produce incompatible output?
- How are conflicts resolved when multiple authentication methods are available for the same tool?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST discover available MCP tools and analyze their capabilities automatically
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to create reusable queries from MCP tool operations
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a CLI interface for executing saved queries with parameterization
- **FR-004**: System MUST support registration of custom data collectors that can feed into queries
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle MCP authentication flows and store credentials securely for reuse
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a standardized interface that abstracts different MCP tool implementations
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow queries to accept data collector output as input parameters
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate compatibility between data collector output and query input requirements
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist queries and authentication credentials for future sessions
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide error handling and rollback for failed query executions

*Unclear requirements requiring clarification:*
- **FR-011**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific MCP authentication methods - API keys, OAuth, basic auth, custom protocols?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST store credentials for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what duration - session-based, persistent, configurable expiration?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate data collector output [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what validation rules - schema validation, type checking, custom validators?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle query versioning when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how to handle tool API changes - automatic migration, manual updates, version compatibility matrix?]

### Key Entities
- **Query**: Reusable operation template containing tool invocation patterns, parameter definitions, and expected output formats
- **Data Collector**: Custom modules that gather data from external sources and format it for query consumption
- **Tool Definition**: Metadata about MCP tools including capabilities, authentication requirements, and parameter schemas
- **Credential Store**: Secure storage for authentication tokens, API keys, and other access credentials
- **Execution Context**: Runtime environment that combines queries, data collectors, and credentials for operation execution
